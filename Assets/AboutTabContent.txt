==Overview
Shazam is a popular mobile app that can identify a song being played. This C# WPF app does something like that. Plus, it calls a lyrics web service to try to get lyrics for the identified song. It can save song info in Azure SQL DB via Web API or in local MySQL DB.

==Quick points on major folders
ViewModelsViews - MainViewModel (one partial class per tab, e.g. MainViewModel.Azure.cs) and user controls (one per tab)

Services - each service (used by MainViewModel) supports one aspect of the app

AzureADClientSecret - Azure AD bear token authentication stuff

Data / Migrations - Code First DbContext for MySQL + Entity Framework (would be similar if MS SQL Server were used)

ClientServerShared - requests and responses for Web API, DTOs, constants, and so on, shared between client and server projects

==Shazam tab
Listen to a device (mic or speaker) selected from the dropdown list.  When identified, a list of songs will be displayed，plus lyrics (if found) will be shown on the right side of the screen.  Usually, you could select a song from the list to save it with the lyrics in Azure SQL DB (via Web API) or local MySQL DB.

You can open currently selected YouTube video externally with default web browser.

==Azure tab
Saved song info list in Azure SQL DB (via Web API) will be displayed on the left-panel. When an item is selected in the list, the matching YouTube video will display on the right side.

You can delete a selected item in the list via Web API.

==MySQL tab
Similar to Azure tab, but data store is local MySQL DB.  The choice of MySQL + Entity Framework is simply for research.  Note: MySQL needs to be installed and configured properly, and small changes in MySQLContext.cs will be required.

Since MySQL is assumed not installed, default mode on this tab is Demo that shows a predefined read-only list.

==About tab
It is this tab with a RichTextBox containing a FlowDocument with Paragraphs built programmatically.
